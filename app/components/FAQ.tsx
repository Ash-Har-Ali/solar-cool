      "What are the cost savings of switching to Solarcool's trending appliances as compared to the traditional ones?",
    answer:
      "As compared to the traditional home/office appliances, Solarcoolâ€™s latest set of appliances uses the most modern BLDC technology and works with solar power sources as well. This results in reducing the power consumption by 70%.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long does it take to recoup the investment in BLDC appliances?",
    answer:
      "Just six months! Yes, it takes only six months to recoup the investment made in BLDC appliances, which is usually a bit higher compared to the traditional ones, due to the high amount required for the purchase of appliances and installation.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does a BLDC air conditioner work with solar power and is it effective on cloudy days?",
    answer:
      "A BLDC air conditioner works efficiently with solar power due to its energy-efficient design. It just needs a solar panel, inverter, and battery storage. On cloudy days, the battery storage or grid connection will help it be reliable.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do I need batteries or a backup power source for the BLDC appliances while using a solar power source?",
    answer:
      "Yes, battery storage is a must for the BLDC appliances to work on solar power sources. And the backup power source or a connected grid can help during cloudy days.",

  {
    question:
      "Can a single BLDC air conditioner power my entire home cooling system?",
    answer:
      "No, a single BLDC air conditioner cannot power your entire home cooling system. The BLDC air conditioners, just like the traditional ones, are designed only to provide cooling for a specific area or room.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the advantages of the BLDC technology?",
    answer:
      "In BLDC home and office appliances, there is no friction between the moving mechanical parts and starting power is very low. This helps in reducing the power consumption by a great extent.",
